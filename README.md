This is a TensorFlow implementation based on my "[Graph-based Image
Classification](https://github.com/rusty1s/deep-learning-on-graphs/tree/master/masterthesis)"
master thesis.

## Requirements

Project is tested on Python 2.7, 3.4 and 3.5.

To install the additional required python packages, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Miniconda

If you have [Miniconda
installed](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/install/quick.html#miniconda-quick-install-requirements),
you can simply run

```bash
./bin/install.sh <name>
```

to install all dependencies (including TensorFlow and nauty/pynauty) in a new
conda environment with name `<name>`.

For configuration and usage of the install script, run:

```bash
./bin/install.sh --help
```

To install Miniconda, run

```bash
./bin/conda.sh
```

and add `~/.miniconda/bin` to your path.

## Running tests

Install the test requirements:

```bash
pip install -r requirements_test.txt
```

Run the test suite:

```bash
./bin/test.sh
```

## Package structure

* `bin`: Shell scripts to test and install.
* `data`: Contains the datasets and helper methods to access and write
  datasets.
* `grapher`: Graph generating algorithms.
* `model`: Wrapper for learning CNNs based on a simple JSON network structure
  file.
* `networks`: Contains all network structures that were used for training and
  evaluation.
* `patchy`: PatchySan implementation.
* `segmentation.algorithm`: Segmentation algorithms.
* `segmentation`: Extracts segment features and spatial neighborhood
  information based on a given segmentation.
